long_description    GCAM is the free GNU Computer Aided Manufacturing package. \
                Most 3-Axis Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) mills such as \
                the Taig, Sherline and Haas are supported in both english and \
                metric units. GCAM has a simple interface for making bolt holes, \
                drill holes, sketches, templates, and more. After extruding these \
                entities one can export the corresponding G-code for the selected \
                cutting tool(s).
